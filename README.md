# Module-4_Python_Module_End_Project

**Project Overview**

This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC Company, which consists of 458 rows and 9 columns. The objective is to preprocess the dataset, perform various analyses, and present key insights using graphical representations.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains information about employees, including:

Employee ID

Name

Age

Height

Salary

Team

Position

**Preprocessing Steps**
1) Fixing the 'Height' Column: The height values were replaced with random numbers between 150 cm and 180 cm to correct inconsistencies.


**Analysis Tasks**
1.Employee Distribution Across Teams -
Counted the number of employees in each team and calculated the percentage of total employees.

2.Employee Distribution by Position
Categorized employees based on their job positions.

3.Predominant Age Group
Grouped employees into age brackets (20-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40) and determined the most common age group.

4.Highest Salary Expenditure
Identified which team and position have the highest total salary expenditure.

5.Correlation Between Age and Salary
Analyzed whether there is a relationship between employee age and salary using scatter plots.

**Graphical Representations**

Each analysis was visualized using appropriate plots:

1.Bar Chart: Employee count per team and per position.

2.Bar Chart: Employees categorized by age group.

3.Bar Chart: Salary expenditure by team and position.

4.Scatter Plot: Age vs. Salary correlation.


**Insights Gained**

1.Team Salary Analysis

2.Certain teams have significantly higher salary expenditure, indicating key revenue-driving departments.

3.Position-Based Salary Distribution

4.Senior-level positions (e.g., Managers, Directors) contribute to the highest salary allocation.

5.Age Group Trends
The 20-25 age group has the highest number of employees, suggesting a young workforce.

6.Correlation Between Age and Salary
There is no strong correlation between age and salary, meaning salary is more dependent on position and experience rather than age alone.
